## Privacy Policy

This privacy policy details how Argus as a Chrome extension collects and stores data.

### Information Collection

Argus collects tab data at regular intervals and sends this data to a host configured by the user, giving them full control over where their data is sent. Further, the data includes only information about the tabs that the user visits, such as url and title, and no further personally identifiable information such as name, email address, or location. Information like this will only be sent if it is included specifically in a tab's data (such as its url or title, as mentioned before).

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

This privacy policy may be changed at any time. The specific changes made can be tracked via the git history for this file.

By using this Chrome extension, you agree to this privacy policy.
